This syntax definitions provide highlighting the common text objects used by the Zim Desktop Wiki (http://zim-wiki.org/). Basically the Zim wiki syntax is the same Dokuwiki (http://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) uses, but with some significant differences. So I decided to write this simple syntax file, for situations when you want to edit a Zim wiki page without the possibility to use Zim itself.
You can now also create Zim wiki pages by inserting a the typical Zim 0.4 file header by typing C-T C-Z or using the abbreviation 'zimhead'.
